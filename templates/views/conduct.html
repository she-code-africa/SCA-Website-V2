    <section class="code-of-conduct">
      <p><span class="font-weight-bolder">She Code Africa (SCA)</span> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
        experience
        for
        everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
        physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants
        in any form.
        This code of conduct applies to all She Code Africa spaces, including Slack, both online and off.
        Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the
        discretion of the Community Managers.
        Some She Code Africa spaces (such as specific Slack channels) may have additional rules in place,
        which will be made clearly available to members. Members are responsible for knowing and abiding by
        these rules. We encourage all those who are members of She Code Africa to help us create safe and
        positive community experiences.
        Consequences for noncompliance with the Code of Conduct may include a discussion with mediators,
        mediation with the member you may have harmed, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community.

      <h1 class="text-primary-color"><strong>Reporting Guidelines</strong></h1>
      <p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to She Code Africa by
        emailing
        info@shecodeafrica.org, Contacting a Core Team member privately on via email, by text or phone call, or in
        person
        communicating with the event organizer (if you’re at an event). <strong>All reports will be kept
          confidential.</strong>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities
        of all
        victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-primary-color">What happens after you file a report?</h1>
      <p>
        You will receive an email from the She Code Africa acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge
        receipt
        within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).
        <br>
        The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What happened.</li>
        <li>Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
        </li>
        <li>Who the bad actor was.</li>
        <li>Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's physical safety.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the working groups' immediate
        priority
        will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the
        situation
        has ended and that everyone is physically safe.
        Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond.
        Responses
        may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
        <li>A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
        </li>
        <li>A public reprimand.</li>
        <li>An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from mailing lists).
        </li>
        <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all SCA spaces (mailing lists)
        </li>
        <li>A request for a public or private apology.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of
        why the
        situation is not yet resolved.
